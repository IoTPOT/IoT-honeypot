# IoT-honeypot
We implement IoTPOT, a novel honeypot to emulate Telnet services of various IoT devices to analyze ongoing attacks in depth. IoTPOT consists of a frontend low-interaction responder cooperating with backend high-interaction virtual environments called IoTBOX. IoTBOX operates various virtual environments commonly used by embedded systems for different CPU architectures.
